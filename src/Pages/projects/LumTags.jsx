            <h2 className="heading-2 text-amber-600">Technological Challenges Overcome</h2>
            <div className="space-y-4">
                <p>During the development of F1nsight, there were several challenges related to handling real-time data visualization and presenting race statistics in a clear and engaging manner. One of the most complex features was the creation of the Interactive Telemetry Viewer, which required integrating 3D modeling and real-time data updates. We overcame this challenge by leveraging Three.js for 3D rendering and integrating race data from external APIs to ensure accuracy.</p>
                <p>Another significant challenge was ensuring that the AR viewer was fully mobile-responsive, allowing users to interact with the AR F1 car model on both phones and tablets. We used Model-Viewer to integrate AR seamlessly, allowing users to bring the F1 cars into their physical environment.</p>

            <p>
                LumTags revolutionizes event photography by delivering a seamless, AI-powered photo experience. Attendees no longer have to sift through hundreds of event photos; instead, they receive a curated gallery featuring only their images, enhancing privacy and engagement.
